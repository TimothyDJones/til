## Overview

## Notes

- Christianity is:
  - coherent worldview
  - lifestyle and not a "religion"
- Allegiance to Christ over faith in Christ
  - What is the difference?
  - Does the difference matter?
  - Is _allegiance_ a Biblical concept/principle?

## Class Outline

### Week 1 - "Nothing Less"
- "My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less"
  - How many of you have sung this song?
  - How many have sung it more than 10 times in your life (or at least since you were baptized)?
  - Have you thought about the meaning and _theological_ implications of the words? Moreover, do you believe, _truly_ believe, those words?



### Week 2



### Week 3 - "Faith or Allegiance" (or "Faith versus Allegiance")
- Gk. _pistis_
- Latin _fidelis_
  - _semper fidelis_ - Marine Corps motto
  - "Adeste fidelis" - "O Come All Ye Faithful"
- "I pledge allegiance to the flag..."
  - What do we mean when we say those words?
- _I Pledge Allegiance to the **Lamb**_
  - Ray Boltz - 1994
  - One of the "classics" of "early" contemporary Christian music.
  - Chorus  
	I pledge allegiance to the lamb  
	With all my strength  
	With all I am  
	I will seek to honor His commands  
	I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

  - Does it matter that Ray Boltz is gay? Does that change the meaning of the song?
