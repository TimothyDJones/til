## Overview
A study of the intersection of doctrine and belief and how it affects our witness for Christ in the post-modern age, particularly across intergenerational lines, with the need for the church to maintain relevance for future generations and to attract and keep young members (young adults, families with school-age children, etc.). Specifically, we look at how the church can and should respond to a rapidly changing world, while staying true to Christ and His teachings. Many of the topics are difficult and uncomfortable for "traditional" minds, but they are vital to carrying out Jesus' commandment to "go and make disciples" (Matthew 28:18-20).

While not a study based _directly_ on any of these books, it takes many ideas and concepts from them:
- _[Salvation by Allegiance Alone: Rethinking Faith, Works, and the Gospel of Jesus the King](https://books.google.com/books?id=exPeDAAAQBAJ)_, [Matthew W. Bates](http://matthewwbates.com/), 2017
- _[Finding the Right Hills to Die on: The Case for Theological Triage](https://books.google.com/books?id=iS0xyQEACAAJ)_, [Gavin Ortlund](https://gavinortlund.com/), 2020
- _[Scandalous Witness: A Little Political Manifesto for Christians](https://books.google.com/books?id=X6zSDwAAQBAJ)_, [Lee C. Camp](https://www.leeccamp.com/), 2020
- _[The Universe Next Door: A Basic Worldview Catalog, Sixth Edition](https://books.google.com/books?id=IxLPDwAAQBAJ)_, James W. Sire, 2020


## Notes

### Principles/Core Concepts
- Christianity is:
  - a _coherent_, self-sufficient worldview
  - a lifestyle and not a "religion"
- Allegiance to Christ over faith in Christ
  - What is the difference?
  - Does the difference matter?
  - Is _allegiance_ a Biblical concept/principle?

## Class Outline

### Week 1 - "Nothing Less"
- "My Hope Is Built on Nothing Less"
  - How many of you have sung this song?
  - How many have sung it more than 10 times in your life (or at least since you were baptized)?
  - Have you thought about the meaning and _theological_ implications of the words? Moreover, do you believe, _truly_ believe, those words?
  - "Theological entrapment"
    - Entrapment - Leading someone into doing something that under normal circumstances they wouldn't otherwise do for the purpose of causing them to do something wrong or criminal.



### Week 2 - "Of First Importance"
- "Of first importance..." - 1 Corinthians 15:3-8 (ESV)
  - that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures (v. 3)
  - that he was buried (v. 4)
  - that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures (v. 4)
  - and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve (v. 5)
  - Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time (v. 6)
  - Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles. (v. 7)
  - Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me. (v. 8)
  - In vs. 1-2, Paul goes so far as to say that _this_ gospel is what saves us and that if it is **not** _this_ gospel that we follow, then our belief (faith/allegiance!) is in vain!
- So where is... ?
  - Baptism
  - Non-instrumental music
  - Etc.
  - Aren't _those_ important too? Indeed, _some_ of those things are _very_ important, but they are simply of **first** importance.
- Does this mean that some beliefs and practices are of more importance than others?
- Are there ranks or gradations of importance? And, if so, how do we decide what beliefs belong in each of them?
  - Theological "triage"
    - importance (or "essentiality")
    - urgency
- Could what is important (other than of "first importance", of course!) change over time? Are some of the things that we have considered important historically, less important (or perhaps even _unimportant_) now?
- Ortlund's principles
  1. first-rank doctrines are _essential_ to the **gospel itself**; 
  2. second-rank doctrines are _urgent_ for the **health and practice of the church** such that they frequently cause Christians to separate at the level of local church, denomination, and/or ministry; 
  3. third-rank doctrines are _important_ to **Christian theology**, but not enough to justify separation or division among Christians; and 
  4. fourth-rank doctrines are _unimportant_ to our gospel witness and ministry collaboration.

### Week 3 - "Faith or Allegiance" (or "Faith versus Allegiance")
- Gk. _pistis_
- Latin _fidelis_
  - _semper fidelis_ - Marine Corps motto
  - "Adeste fidelis" - "O Come All Ye Faithful"
- "I pledge allegiance to the flag..."
  - What do we mean when we say those words?
- _I Pledge Allegiance to the **Lamb**_
  - Ray Boltz - 1994
  - One of the "classics" of "early" contemporary Christian music.
  - Chorus  
	I pledge allegiance to the lamb  
	With all my strength  
	With all I am  
	I will seek to honor His commands  
	I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JK4Tn1lLBDI
  - Does it matter that Ray Boltz is gay? Does that change the meaning of the song?
