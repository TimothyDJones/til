## Rust Variables

### Integers

#### Signed Integers

#### Unsigned Integers


### Floating Point Numbers
Numbers with a decimal point that include a fractional part. Name comes from the computer science term [floating-point arithmetic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic), which is how computers represent these numbers accurately when all of the internal calculations are done with binary (base 2) numbers.

### Strings
Strings represent textual elements of more than one character in Rust. For historical reasons, programmers call a sequence of text (or other symbolic) characters with a particular order ["strings"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(computer_science)). (This naming _probably_ comes typesetting in which characters were "strung" together into words and lines for page layout.)

#### Characters
For individual (single) characters in Rust, we use single quotes to delimit (identify) them. (You can remember this by: Single character --> Single quotes!)
