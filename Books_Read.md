|  ![Cover of "Deeper"](https://coverart.oclc.org/ImageWebSvc/oclc/+-+7195012876_140.jpg) | _Deeper: Real Change for Real Sinners_ (2021) | [Dane Ortlund](https://www.daneortlund.com/) | 

A practical look at how Christians grow as individuals and as part of the church (body of Christ). As indicated by the title, Ortlund focuses on depth of growth _into_ Christ, rather than mere expansion of one's involvement. He mainly uses references from Christian pillars of the distant and recent past to support his positions. (Part of the Crossway (*Union*)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08QCJKZPH] series.) |

### Justification (Chapter 6)
- *Justification* is **outside-in**. Justification **occurs once** when we accept Christ (at baptism?).
- *Sanctification* is **inside-out**. Sanctification **continues throughout our lives** as Christians and happens incrementally.

 | ![Cover of "Fairy Tale"](https://coverart.oclc.org/ImageWebSvc/oclc/+-+3839379476_140.jpg) | _Fairy Tale: A Novel_ (2022) | [Stephen King](https://stephenking.com/) | A teenager helps an old man in distress and inherits his ramshackle home. The home has a shed with a portal to an alternate world. The boy, along with the aging dog he also inherited, enters the alternate world and finds a high-stakes war between good and evil that has repercussions not only for the alternate world, but for the "real" world, as well. He makes new friends in the alternate world with those who knew the old man and helps rescue that world. | 
 
 ### Lessons
 - People are not always what they seem initially. Those who look good at first may turn out to be evil and, more importantly, vice versa.
 - Friendship and loyalty are more valuable than all the gold in the world. Material wealth can't help you in time of utter distress and need, but friends can.
 - Beauty comes from within, rather than without.
 
 Overall, I enjoyed *Fairy Tale*, but I didn't find it as engrossing as some of Stephen King's novels. Several points in the story dragged or seemed out of place. Ultimately, the second half of the book had the trademark King action and philosophical lessons and that more than made up for it.

 ## Legend
- *Summary* - A brief explanation of the book content. May include information from external sources, as well as my own input. I try to be as objective as possible and reserve editorial statements for *Key Points* section. üòÄ
- *Key Points* - For non-fiction, this section includes the main information that I gleaned from the book that was most relevant to me. This may or may *not* be the main points that the *author* wished to convey. For fiction, this tends to be the main thematic elements, along with the metanarrative aspects most salient in the story and the lessons taught (eg., value of friendship, etc.). Likewise, I will generally provide an overall assessment of the book to comport with the *Rating*.
- *Rating* - My personal rating of the book on a scale of 0 - 5 stars, with:
	- 0 = either I didn't finish or read enough to provide a valid assessment
	- 1 = didn't enjoy it much at all or find anything useful or redeeming about it
	- 2 = rather weak in its arguments/facts or presentation; difficult to read for the value; or, otherwise below par
	- 3 = an average (good) book with plenty of good/enjoyable about it, but nothing that makes it stand above and beyond others of this genre or topic
	- 4 = an excellent book that held my attention easily and made me want to continue reading and/or read more of the author's work; arguments/facts were easy to follow/check and well-supported
	- 5 = an absolute classic/most outstanding of its genre/topic (or it will be!)

	- *Reading* - Still in progress of reading.
